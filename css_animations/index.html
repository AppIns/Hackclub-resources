		Css animations are easy. Inspect this page. There is no JavaScript file on this page.
		<p> 
			Start by creating a new HTML file inside a new folder. It should look something like this:
			<br>
			<code>
				&lt;html&gt;
				<br>
				&emsp;	&lt;head&gt;
				<br>
				&emsp;&emsp;  &lt;link href="styles.css" rel="stylesheet"&gt;
				<br>
				&emsp;	&lt;/head&gt;
				<br>
				&emsp;	&lt;body&gt;
				<br>
				&emsp;	&lt;/body&gt;
				<br>
				&lt;/html&gt;
			</code>
		</p>
		<p>
			<br>
			<br>
			I can not stress this enough,
			<h3> If you want to make this your own, feel free to Google (or ask) for help </h3>
			Now create a file called styles.css in the same folder, most of our work will be in here.
			<br>
			To start out, we should create out first animation. Please don't copy paste the code,
			<br>
		 	type it out. You really want to remember how to do this without looking every time.
			<code> 
				@keyframes animation_name {
				<br>&emsp;from{color:red;}
				<br>&emsp;to  {color:blue;}
				<br>}
			</code>
			<br>
			We load our page but nothing happens...
			<br>
			Well we need an element to change, so lets do that.
			<br>
			Add some element. Why not some text? Lets add a P element.
			<br>
			<code>
			&lt;p&gt;
			Some text here
			&lt;/p&gt;
			</code>
			<br>
			Now lets change it in CSS
			<code>
				p{<br>
				&emsp;	animation-name: animation_name;<br>
				&emsp;	animation-duration: 4s;<br>
				}
			</code>
			<p id="redtoblue"> It should look something like this </p>
			<p> If you want it to repeat several times, add something like </p>
			<code> animation-iteration-count: infinite; </code>
			<br>
			If you want to delay the animation by several seconds, use
			<br>
			<code>
				animation-delay: 1s;
			</code>
			There are many other things you can do with just animations, One major one
			<br>
			I left out is the ability to have more than just a 'to' and 'from' statement.
			<br>
			You can replace them with 0% and 100% and add other values in between.
			<br>
			If you want to learn more about them, see <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_animations.asp">this website</a> all about animations.

			<h1>What now?</h1>
                        We are now competing to build the best website using css animations. You may submit one site that you think might beat all of the others
			<br>
			They will be rated on:
			<li>
				<ul>Humor: include memes, sounds, pictures, and other goofs</ul>
				<ul>Un-usablity/Useablity: Your website should either make someone dizzy or be an ease to the reader. Try moving text boxes around randomly or allow their eyes to rest and read.</ul>
				<ul>Creativity: Your website should be different from your neighbors.</ul>
				<ul>Bad/Good: Using animations, you can make your website both very bad and very good</ul>
				<ul>Boldness: Use something you found on google, or several things you found on google. Create elements with animations that happen when you hover over them and such</ul>
				<ul>Pain/Ease (Optional): It should be very painful or very easy to use your website.</ul>
				<ul>Memes (Optional): Include grand macs, timbs, the B emoji, whom, or some other great meme.</ul>
			</li>

	<h2>Ideas</h2>
	<ul>
		<li id="hover">Use :hover to get elements to change when you hover over them.</li>
		<li id="size">Make elements change size by editing their width and height properties.</li>
		<li class="shake">Make elements do several changes at the same exact time (see top of this page).</li>
		<li>Make elments spin by using something like "transform: rotate(180deg);" and "transform:roate(0deg);" to rotate the element.</li>	
		<li>Make elements go from sqaures to circles by editing their "border-radius" property.</li>
		<li>Add in some delayed animations to have a fade in sequence.</li>
		<li>Add in a song and have it synced to the animations.</li>	
		<li>Have a huge picture that is scrolled up or down by changing its margin-top (ask me).</li>
		<li>Edit a background picture to scroll. I'm not sure how you would do this, but I bet it's possible.</li>
		<li id="shake2">Make elements shake back and forth by setting the margin-left and 
		margin-top to negative and postive numbers (do 20 to -20 to 20 and repeat).</li>

	</ul>
	Still not satisfied? Tried all of those and don't like them? Go <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp">here</a> and pick one of the many topics on their sidebar. Yoy can find all sorts of stuff I just didn't list here <br>
	<h2>If you have a problem, ask me. Don't give up, keep trying. Do well and you will win!</h2>
