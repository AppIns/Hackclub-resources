### Poster Creator
To use the poster creator, visit the `poster` directory.
You can edit the files `index.html` and `styles.css` to change elements of the poster.
If you want to get the poster, open up a browser and print it to a PDF file. Then send
or print the PDF.

### CSS Animations (HTML workshop... oops...)
A little workshop I created to be much less brittle than most other projects.
It has some examples built into the HTML file and helps people who are getting
off track and deciding to copy the code. It encourages people to google solutions
and is very wide open.

### Text Button (Markdown workshop)
A workshop I created that people with a good skill level would have fun with.
Unfortunately, It didn't work too well with my school and wasn't really fun. If
you had someone copy the code, you likely wouldn't have it last more than 20
minutes. Although it isn't brittle, so you can swap out the code fairly easily.
