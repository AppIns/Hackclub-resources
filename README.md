### Poster Creator
To use the poster creator, visit the `poster` directory.
You can edit the files `index.html` and `styles.css` to change elements of the poster.
If you want to get the poster, open up a browser and print it to a PDF file. Then send
or print the PDF.

### CSS Animations
A little workshop I created to be much less brittle than most other projects.
